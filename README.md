# InfixToPostfix_Evaluation
Data Structures.. the Program Takes an infix expression as input i.e (a^b)-c+d/e then takes input for each variable and after converting input to postfix displays the result after evaluation.
the results are then give the apostfix of the infix which are further used for detecting the more feasible solution.
